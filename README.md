## Description

A memory game

### WireFrame

Since I am following a tutorial and sources on the web. I want to make sure not to totally rob myself of thinking through the problem as if I didn't have any resources and had to invent from scratch. Here are the functions I think I'll need before following tutorials:

1. Functions I think I'll need in no particular order. Just brainstorming:
   1. Setting the card pairs to match each other. 
   if (name = name){cardArray.name.pop()}else{turn back over}
   
   2. they disappear when they do. 
   pop(), shift() or .remove(nameOfCardPair)
   
   3. they turn back over if they don't.
   else(this i'm not sure of. right now each image is attached to another image, the cardGreen jpg, which represents the back of the card. This is about one element having two images. the function
   needs to TOGGLE I think!) 
   
   4. Flip function for the visual element
   
   5. A Win function when all cards match
   
   6. Random reset function for new game. The deck has to be reset in a random way as to not repeat the last game pattern.
