A memory game

### WireFrame

Since I am following a tutorial and sources on the web. I want to make sure not to totally rob myself of thinking through the problem as if I didn't have any resources and had to invent from scractch. Here are the functions I think I'll need before following tutorials:
1. Functions I think I'll need in no particular order. Just brainstorming:
    1. Setting the card pairs to match each other.
    2. they disappear when they do.
    3. they turn back over if they don't.
    4. Flip function for the visual element
    5. A Win function when all cards match 
    6. Random reset function for new game. The deck has to be reset in a random way as to not repeat the last game pattern.
